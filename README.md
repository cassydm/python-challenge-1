_Module 2 Challenge due 5/23/24. Created by Cassy Miller_

The file "project_menu_final" walks you thorough the process of ordering from the newest food truck in town: Cassy's Baked Potato Bar.

You will have the option to order from the menu whatever your heart desires, using user inputs.

This module is very user friendly and readable. 

Enjoy your hypothetical meal!
